# Echosever
This is question 2 for CECS 326. Creating a echo server
Question 2: Echo Server
How the program works. The program is an echo server. the server is going to repeat what the client sends to the server. Just like real life the echo is going to be repeat what the client has sent. 

There are going to be two differnt prompts. On the client terminal there is going to be a measage saying 

                "Enter Text:        "
                "Client:            "

The user in the client side is going to put in some text. When the text is sent. The server is going to repond with the same text that the user had sent. When the server repondes is going to be like 


                                "Server:         "
                                        User measage


The measage is going to be on the client terminal. 

How to Run the program.

To run the program:       Run Echoserver.java,
                          Run Echoclient.java,
                          Type some measages in the client terminal then hit Enter,
                          To end the program and connection is to type "end" in the client text box. the program is going to terminate.
